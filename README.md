# Code 
This simulated the motion of a  rod consisting of a point mass
and a massless stick placed on a vibrating base. 

Consider a CP stick of length $L$ that is connected to a stiffness torsion spring $k$ and damping $\gamma$ placed on the platform that is vibrating, $z_s= A sin omega t$. The stick consists of a mass less rod that has its base at C and the mass $m$ at P. The points $P:(x_p,z_p)$ and $C: (x_c, z_c)$ describe the top and the bottom ends of the stick.  Here, $x_c= x_p- L\sin \theta$  and $z_c= z_p- L\cos \theta $.
